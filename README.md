# Pyramid-Game
 Group/Final project for SWE-325

 The pyramid game is an extremely self explanatory text based adventure game.

 Following the prompts onscreen, the player can navigate a decrepit pyramid.

 Though not required, installing the pyFiglet library allows for a neat askii TitleScreen

 In all rooms, when faced with a decision as to where to travel next, entering q will quit the game.
 
 A fullscreen terminal is suggested, but not required.
