- Should we have all four directions available in each room and just only make the ones 
that we want actually progress, maybe giving short descriptions about sides of current room on other choices?

- Should we hold onto some sort of record of what happens, give a play by play summary upon game completion?

- Time/compatibility to incorporate a Tkinter screen at end of game?
